# Part 1: Downloading the Arduino IDE
The Arduino IDE is a coding environment designed for creating and editing code for Arduino programs (also called sketches). The IDE can be downloaded from the official Arduino website at https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software. Download the latest version of the IDE, version 1.8.13, and install it onto your computer. Most important details of the IDE will be covered during the workshop sessions, and even if you do not have a physical Arduino board to program we recommend that you try writing code inside of the IDE so that you can familiarize yourself with its features, which include color coding for keywords.

# Part 2: Signing up for a TinkerCAD account
TinkerCAD allows you to create projects such as circuits and then store them in the cloud where they can be shared with other users. To create your account, go to https://www.tinkercad.com/ and click the “JOIN NOW” button in the top right. You should create a personal account, and sign up using your email or link an existing account. Once you have signed up, you can access your dashboard by clicking the logo in the top left corner. By default it will show your existing 3D designs, but you can switch to show your circuits using the menu on the left. There is a button you can use to create a new circuit, which will bring up the TinkerCAD circuit editor. We will be using this editor starting in our first session.
