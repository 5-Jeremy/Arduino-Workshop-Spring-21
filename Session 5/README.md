# Session 5: Final Project Wrap-Up and Data Logging

## Final Project
The sample solution to the final project which was reviewed during session 5 is available in the final project folder under session 4.

## Software Needed for Data Logging Using Simulink
As mentioned in session 5, the demonstration for logging data in Simulink uses the software MATLAB and Simulink as well as two add-ons, the Instrument Control Toolbox and the Aerospace Blockset. Links to the online documentation for this software can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yLpU3r8ddTW1j8wUCquHIzXUr6ubLOO2YhhUy5JZ4gQ/edit).
