# Arduino-Workshop-Spring-21
This repo hosts all of the files required for practice assignments and the final project that is part of the Spring 2021 Arduino workshop hosted by UCR UAS. In addition, sample code used during the sessions may be made available as Arduino sketches, and links to relevant TinkerCAD projects will be put in the README documents as needed.

Recordings of each of the sessions in this workshop series are available [here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfmzHX29KVv_cbdHYJD3cuvoo_Valq8us).

Extra materials such as the slides for each session can be found via the [UCR UAS website](https://ucr-uas.weebly.com/workshops.html).
