# Arduino-Workshop-Spring-21
This repo hosts all of the files required for practice assignments and the final project that is part of the Spring 2021 Arduino workshop hosted by UCR UAS. In addition, sample code used during the sessions may be made available as Arduino sketches, and links to relevant TinkerCAD projects will be put in the README documents as needed.
