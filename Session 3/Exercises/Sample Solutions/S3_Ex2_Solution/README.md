# How to See the Sample Solution in Action
Along with the code provided for this sample solution, which is provided in the form of an Arduino sketch like with past sample solutions, you will need to construct a circuit that matches the image below. If you do not match the wiring exactly, the code may not cause the intended behavior. Note that the multimeter at the top is not necessary. Once you have replicated the circuit, you can simply insert the solution code into the virtual Arduino and run the simulation.
